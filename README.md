# WeatherSerchHW# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

I begun this project by finding my API key and query URL, this part was fairly simple but I took my time to ensure I was using the right URL and key.I had simple goal which was to get the correct temperature on the results container. This turned out to be one of the hardest parts of the assignment, after making my initial AJAX call and attempting to console log my response with no success. After a few hours of trying to figure out where I made a mistake in my code I realized that I had not linked JQuery -_- after realizing this oversight progress became steady and mostly repetetive with retrieving the specific information for the current weather and appending it to my results container. The process for the forecast weather was similar but a bit more tricky with the integration of the for loop. I was able to repeatedly display the temperatures but after adding the rest of the data I was not able to get it to work again.
